# InstaBoost - Phishing Awareness Demonstration 🚨

## 🌟 Project Overview
InstaBoost is a **phishing awareness** project designed to demonstrate the deceptive ease of creating convincing fake websites. This project features a simulated Instagram follower-boosting site that mirrors real interfaces, showcasing how easily users can be tricked into entering personal information. The primary goal is to **educate users** about phishing risks and highlight how such scams can appear highly authentic even with minimal technical knowledge.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of InstaBoost is to **illustrate the simplicity of creating phishing sites** using basic web development skills. It underscores the need for vigilance when dealing with unfamiliar websites, especially those requesting sensitive information. Building this project provided a valuable learning experience, allowing me to enhance my professional skills while creating a realistic phishing demonstration.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the webpage layout and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, ensuring the site resembles a real Instagram interface.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, including form validation and dynamic button activation.
- **Google Apps Script**: For capturing form submissions and simulating data theft.

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1. **Homepage - InstaBoost Phishing Site**
- A **visually appealing landing page** that promises users **instant Instagram follower boosts**.
- Designed to mimic real-life phishing scams, enticing users to input personal credentials.

### 2. **Login Page**

- **Login button** is initially disabled and only activates when both fields are filled, enhancing the realism.
- Features a **"Forgot password?"** link to increase trustworthiness.

### 3. **Phishing Simulation with Google Apps Script**
- Captures user input via a Google Apps Script, simulating how phishing sites gather personal data.
- Demonstrates how easily attackers can **steal sensitive information**, even with minimal technical expertise.

## 🛡️ Educational Focus
