# InstaBoost - Phishing Awareness Demonstration 🚨

## 🌟 Project Overview
InstaBoost is a **phishing awareness** project that demonstrates how deceptively real-looking websites can be built with **basic web development skills**. The website mimics a fake Instagram follower-boosting service, illustrating the tactics used by phishing sites to trick users into entering sensitive information. The project’s main goal is to **educate users about the dangers of phishing attacks** and how much more authentic these scams can look if developed by an expert.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project highlights how **easy it is to create phishing websites** with minimal technical knowledge. It demonstrates the **risks** of interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially those that request **personal or login information**. As a developer, this project gave me a valuable opportunity to sharpen my skills while building a real-world phishing demonstration. It stands as a **cautionary tale** and learning experience for both users and developers.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the website’s layout.
- **CSS3**: Crafting a visually appealing and familiar design.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity, like form validation and button activation.
- **Google Apps Script**: Simulating how phishing websites collect and process data.

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1. **Homepage - InstaBoost Phishing Site**
- A professional-looking **landing page** that promises users **instant Instagram follower boosts**.
- Designed to resemble real-life scams, enticing users to take action.

### 2. **Login Page**
- An almost exact replica of Instagram’s login page with **fields for username and password**.
- **Interactive login button** only enables when both fields are filled, adding to the realism.
- Includes familiar links like **"Forgot password?"** to enhance user trust.

### 3. **Phishing Simulation with Google Apps Script**
- The form captures user input and sends it to a backend script, simulating the **data theft process** of phishing sites.
- Demonstrates how attackers can easily **steal personal data**, even with minimal coding knowledge.

## 🛡️ Educational Focus
- **Phishing Awareness**: This project shows how real phishing sites can look and feel, emphasizing the importance of being cautious online.
- **Cybersecurity**: Raising awareness about the risks of entering personal information on unfamiliar sites.
- **Developer Growth**: Provided an opportunity to enhance my **web development skills** and address the **ethical responsibilities** of developers.

## 🛠️ User Interaction
The site is designed to lead users into believing they're accessing a legitimate Instagram service. The login page captures their credentials and submits them to the backend, showing how easily personal data can be compromised. This serves as a reminder to always verify websites before entering sensitive information.
