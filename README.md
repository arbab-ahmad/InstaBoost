InstaBoost - Phishing Awareness Demonstration

Project Overview
InstaBoost is a demonstration website created to raise awareness about phishing techniques and how easily deceptive websites can be built with minimal technical knowledge. The project showcases a fake Instagram follower-boosting website that mimics real interfaces, illustrating how such websites can trick users into providing sensitive information. The goal is to educate users about the risks of phishing and to demonstrate how much more convincing such websites can become if crafted by a skilled developer.

Purpose
This project serves as a demonstration to highlight how phishing websites can be built with basic web development skills. It underscores the importance of awareness when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially those asking for sensitive information. As a developer, building this project also offered a learning opportunity, allowing me to refine my professional skills while creating a real-world phishing demonstration.

Technologies Used
- HTML5: Structured the webpage layout and content.
- CSS3: Styled the site to closely resemble a real Instagram interface.
- JavaScript: Added interactivity, such as form validation and enabling the "Login" button once the fields are filled.
- Google Apps Script: Used to capture form submissions, simulating data theft common in phishing sites.

Components

1. Homepage (InstaBoost Phishing Site)
The homepage mimics typical Instagram-boosting sites, encouraging users to “Boost Your Followers Instantly.” Users are lured with the promise of increasing their follower count quickly by entering personal credentials.

2. Login Page
- Mimics Instagram’s login page to make it appear authentic.
- Fields for "Phone number, username, or email" and "Password."
- The login button is initially disabled and only activates when both fields are filled out, enhancing believability.
- Includes a "Forgot password?" link to make it appear more trustworthy.

3. Phishing Simulation via Google Script
Form submission is captured using a Google Apps Script, simulating how real phishing websites collect personal information. Demonstrates how attackers can steal sensitive credentials and personal data with very little technical expertise.

Educational Focus
- Awareness: This project shows users how easily they can be deceived by websites that mimic well-known brands like Instagram.
- Professional Growth: As a developer, creating this project provided hands-on experience and professional growth, highlighting both ethical concerns and security risks in web development.

User Interaction
Users are led to believe they are logging into a real Instagram service but are actually interacting with a phishing simulation. The site mimics real login functionality, collecting user input and sending it to a backend script (Google Apps Script), illustrating how personal data can be stolen.

By building this project, I aim to show how easily phishing websites can be constructed and the potential dangers of interacting with them, even if they appear legitimate. It also serves as an educational tool to showcase the importance of cybersecurity and awareness in everyday online interactions.
